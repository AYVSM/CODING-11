    <h2>SUPERCELL</h2>
    <p>Supercell is a game company based in Helsinki, Finland, with offices in San Francisco, Seoul and Shanghai. Since our launch in 2010, we've brought six games to the global market - Hay Day, Clash of Clans, Boom Beach, Clash Royale, Brawl Stars and Squad Busters. Our dream is to create great games that as many people as possible play for years and that are remembered forever.</p>

    <p class="p1">
      Why We Are Here
      Supercell was founded on the idea of giving game developers and teams the independence to decide what kinds of games they make and how they choose to make them. Over a decade and five global games later, our dream still stands: to create great games that as many people as possible play for years and that are remembered forever.
      </p>

    <p class="p2">We believe games have the power to bring people around the world together and closer to each other. We work to create new, innovative, memorable experiences no one has played before. This is why we try to design games that excite wide and diverse player communities as well as to expand the audience for otherwise smaller “niche” game concepts.
      </p>

    <p class="p3">
      There's no simple recipe or magic formula to achieve our dream. What we do know, however, is that without players Supercell doesn’t exist. Creating lovable worlds and characters that players want to come back to over and over again is at the heart of how we design and operate our games.

    <p>* In 2010, we believed that creating great games is all about having the best people and providing them with the best possible environment to focus on developing the best games.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, many years later, we realized that it is not only about having the best individuals/people but having the best teams. A group of great individuals does not automatically make a great team.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best team is the one with the best people who work extremely well together.
